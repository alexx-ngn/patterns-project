## Design Paradigm: MVC Architecture

The application is built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:

- **Model:**  
  Manages the core data and business logic of the application. It handles interactions with the account and post databases.
  
  - `User Model`: Manages user data, such as usernames, profiles, and follow lists.
  - `Post Model`: Handles posts, timestamps, likes, and associations with users.
  - `Report Model`: Tracks user reports and their statuses.

- **View:**  
  The GUI, responsible for displaying user interfaces such as the login page, home feed, profile pages, and admin reports.

- **Controller:**  
  Handles user inputs and system interactions. It processes actions such as creating accounts, posting, liking, reporting, and admin actions (like deleting posts and banning users).
